# React Task Manager

## Overview

This is a Task Manager web app built with React, demonstrating modern component-based development with hooks. It consumes a REST API backend for all task operations.

## Features

- Create, view, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Filter tasks by status (All, Pending, Completed)
- Responsive, professional UI
- Loading indicators and error handling
- Form validation and task statistics

## Setup & Usage

1. Ensure your REST API backend is running and accessible.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. Edit `src/utils/api.js` if you need to change the API base URL.
