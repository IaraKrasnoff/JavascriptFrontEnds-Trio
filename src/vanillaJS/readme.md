# Vanilla JavaScript Task Manager

## Overview

This is a Task Manager web app built with modern (ES6+) vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating fundamental web development skills without frameworks. It consumes a REST API backend for all task operations.

## Features

- Create, view, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Filter tasks by status (All, Pending, Completed)
- Responsive, professional UI
- Loading indicators and error handling
- Form validation and task statistics

## Setup & Usage

1. Ensure your REST API backend is running and accessible.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).
3. Edit `api.js` if you need to change the API base URL.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file
- `styles.css` – App styles
- `app.js` – Main application logic
- `api.js` – API interaction module
- `utils.js` – Utility functions

## Notes

- Uses Fetch API and async/await for HTTP requests.
- All code is modular and commented for clarity.
