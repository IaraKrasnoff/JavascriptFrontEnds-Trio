# Vue.js Task Manager

## Overview

This is a Task Manager web app built with Vue.js 3, demonstrating reactive data binding and component-based architecture. It consumes a REST API backend for all task operations.

## Features

- Create, view, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Filter tasks by status (All, Pending, Completed)
- Responsive, professional UI
- Loading indicators and error handling
- Form validation and task statistics

## Setup & Usage

1. Ensure your REST API backend is running and accessible.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (uses Vue via CDN, no build step required).
3. Edit `app.js` if you need to change the API base URL.

## File Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file
- `styles.css` – App styles
- `app.js` – Vue application logic
- `package.json` – (Optional) For npm-based setup

## Notes

- Uses Vue 3 with CDN for simplicity.
- All code is modular and commented for clarity.
